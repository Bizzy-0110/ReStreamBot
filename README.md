ReStreamBot is a bot for Telegram made in 2022 that allows you to re-route your stream in multiple platforms at the same time with the power of a Linux server.
# Installation
#### Clone the repository
```terminal
git clone https://github.com/Bizzy-0110/ReStreamBot.git
```
```terminal
cd ReStreamBot
```
```terminal
pip install requirements.txt
```
#### Install Nginx with the RTMP module
To install Nginx with the RTMP module you can follow [this guide](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/how-to-set-up-your-own-private-rtmp-server-using-nginx.50/).

A summary of the guide can be found under here.

Download dependencies:
```terminal
sudo apt update
```
```terminal
sudo apt install -y build-essential libpcre3 libpcre3-dev libssl-dev 
```

From your home directory, download the nginx source code and get the RTMP module source code from git:
```terminal
wget http://nginx.org/download/nginx-1.15.1.tar.gz
wget https://github.com/sergey-dryabzhinsky/nginx-rtmp-module/archive/dev.zip
```
Unpack/unzip them both, enter the nginx directory and build nginx with the RTMP module:
```terminal
tar -zxvf nginx-1.15.1.tar.gz
```
```terminal
unzip dev.zip
```
```terminal
cd nginx-1.15.1
```
```terminal
./configure --with-http_ssl_module --add-module=../nginx-rtmp-module-dev
```
```terminal
make
```
```terminal
sudo make install 
```

And nginx is installed! By default it installs to /usr/local/nginx, so to start the server run the following command:
```terminal
sudo /usr/local/nginx/sbin/nginx 
```
To restart it, use:
```terminal
sudo /usr/local/nginx/sbin/nginx -s stop
```
```terminal
sudo /usr/local/nginx/sbin/nginx 
```

# Setup
## Bot
Edit the costants at the beginning of the `main.py` according to your needs
And add the bot token and the whitelist members in `secret.json`.
## Nginx
Open the Nginx configuration and add the following
```text
rtmp {
	server {
		listen 1935;
		chunk_size 4096;

		Â application starting_key {

			live on;
			record off;

			meta copy;

			
			# <put here the rtmp servers that you want>
			# Example
			# Youtube
			# push rtmp://a.rtmp.youtube.com/live2/{stream_key};
			# Twitch
			# push rtmp://ingest.global-contribute.live-video.net/app/{stream_key};
		}
	}

}
```
